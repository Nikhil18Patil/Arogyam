Are you worried about your health? Do you have some symptoms that you are not sure about? If so, our disease predictor website can help.
 We offer a simple and easy-to-use tool that allows you to input your symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.
 Our tool is based on the latest medical research, and it can help you identify potential health concerns so that you can seek prompt and accurate treatment .
How it works  Our disease predictor website works by asking you a series of questions about your symptoms.
 Once you have answered the questions, our tool will use a sophisticated algorithm to generate a list of potential diagnoses. 
The list of potential diagnoses will be ranked in order of likelihood, so that you can see which diagnoses are most likely to be the cause of your symptoms.
